Krishna says: "Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon.
I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings.
I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant..!
